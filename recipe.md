# Here is the RECIPE OF EGGLESS WAFFLES

1.Combine the flour, baking powder and sugar.
2.In a separate bowl mix together the milk, oil, water, vanilla and butter.
3.Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and mix together gently. As with all pancake batters, it should be slightly lumpy.
4.Let the batter sit for a few minutes to give it time to puff up.
5.Once your waffle maker is ready to go, depending on the size of your maker, scoop the batter in and enjoy! (for my maker I used 1/4 cup batter for each waffle)
